# Scopa-Card-Game-Mini-Project
Command-line interface version of the popular Italian card game Scopa.

I completed this mini project in Python over two days after my Italian friend introduced me to the game of Scopa. It is a classic case of a game being simple to learn but very difficult to master.

I thought it would make for a great mini-project to make use of classes and OOP, something that I wanted to practise.

The full rules are avaiable online, e.g. [Scopa Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa#Gameplay)
